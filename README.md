# Overview

This repository is a collection of scripts that are used in our Unity game. The main idea of our game is that you
are exploring a dungeon full of letters and you have to solve a riddle to escape. In order to solve the riddle you
have to defeat the letter enemies to collect letters to answer the riddle with.

# Development Environment

We used Unity to develop this software. Each team member used their choice of a text editor to write the C# scripts.

All of the scripts are written in C#.
