# Overview

This is not a collage assignment

This repository is a collection of scripts that are used in our Unity game. The main idea of our game is that you
are exploring a dungeon full of letters and you have to solve a riddle to escape. In order to solve the riddle you
have to defeat the letter enemies to collect letters to answer the riddle with.

# Development Environment

We used Unity to develop this software.

All of the scripts that we wrote and are being used in our Unity game are written in C#
